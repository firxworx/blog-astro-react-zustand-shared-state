# firxworx.com blog - Astro + React Components Sharing State with Zustand

Companion code to a blog post at https://firxworx.com that demonstrates how Astro and React components can share state using a zustand store created with `zustand/vanilla`.

## Prerequisites

The following environment is recommended to run this project:

- linux/unix environment (WSL2 is recommended for Windows users)
- pnpm package manager
- Node v20+ (see `.npmrc` for version config)

If you use VSCode consider adding the extensions listed in `.vscode/settings.json` to your workspace.

Astro's dev server runs at http://localhost:4321 by default.
